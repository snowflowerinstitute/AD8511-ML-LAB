# AD8511 Machine Learning Laboratory
All Programs and their required Datasets

## Topics
1. Implement the concept of **decision trees** with suitable data set from real world problem and classify the data set to produce new sample.
2. Detecting **Spam mails** using Support vector machine
3. Implement **facial recognition** application with artificial neural network
4. Study and implement amazon toolkit: **Sagemaker**
5. Implement **character recognition** using Multilayer Perceptron
6. Implement the non-parametric **Locally Weighted Regression** algorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
7. Implement **sentiment analysis** using random forest optimization algorithm
8. Write a program to construct a **Bayesian network** considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set. You can use Java/Python ML library classes/API.
9. Choose best machine learning algorithm to implement online **fraud detection**
10. Mini-project: duh..

## Side Notes
"datasets/9-fraud-detection.csv" is a _conker_ dataset, you can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
